# YouTube-AdView-Prediction-main
 • Worked on a real-world project to predict YouTube adview counts using machine learning models. 
 • Cleaned and pre-processed a dataset of 15,000 YouTube videos by handling missing values and transforming attributes into numerical values. 
 • Applied linear regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Regressors to model the data. 
 • Performed model evaluation and selected the best model based on performance metrics. Deployed the model and predicted adview counts for unseen data.
